#### Project Description
Accurate thin-film thickness measurement is crucial in various
high-tech fields, including electronics, optics, and materials sci-
ence. Traditional methods like Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
and X-ray Reflectometry (XRR) are reliable but face limitations
such as high cost, contact-induced damage, and inefficiencies in
multi-layer structures. To overcome these challenges, we propose
a model-based approach integrating White-Light Interferometry
(WLI) with Spectral Reflectometry (SR), achieving non-destructive,
high-accuracy measurements. We propose a deep-learning-based
model pipeline that incorporates denoising, structure classification
and layersâ€™ length regression by a hybrid combination of U-Net and
CNN structures. This research provides a robust, scalable
framework for thin-film characterization, meeting the stringent
precision demands of modern industrial applications.
